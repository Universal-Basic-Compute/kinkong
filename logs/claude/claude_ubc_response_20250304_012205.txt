    "score": -4,
    "reasoning": "UBC is showing significant weakness with a -10.64% 24h price change, indicating negative short-term momentum. The relatively low liquidity ($16,923) and 24h volume ($1,930) suggest limited market interest and potential difficulty in executing larger trades without slippage. The neutral market sentiment doesn't provide a catalyst for reversal. While following the token maximizer strategy, the current downtrend and low trading activity suggest better opportunities to accumulate more UBC tokens may come after further price decline. Positioning more heavily in SOL in the short-term would likely allow for acquiring more UBC tokens later."
