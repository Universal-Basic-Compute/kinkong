    "score": 0,
    "reasoning": "Unable to provide a meaningful score due to missing UBC token data. The DexScreener data shows 'null', indicating no available information about price, liquidity, or trading volume. Without this critical information, I cannot determine if UBC is likely to outperform or underperform SOL. The market sentiment is classified as NEUTRAL with moderate confidence, which would typically suggest a neutral stance, but without token-specific data, this assessment cannot be reliably applied to UBC specifically."
