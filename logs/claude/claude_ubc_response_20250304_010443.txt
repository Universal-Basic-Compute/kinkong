    "score": 2,
    "reasoning": "UBC shows moderate positive indicators with a 5% price increase in the last 24 hours and a 10% volume increase. The token has decent liquidity at 500,000 and a stable market cap of 10M. While these metrics suggest some positive momentum, the overall market sentiment is neutral with balanced buying/selling pressure. The token appears to have some growth potential compared to SOL, but without more historical data or comparative SOL metrics, a cautiously optimistic stance is warranted. The positive price and volume trends suggest a slight advantage for token accumulation in the short term."
