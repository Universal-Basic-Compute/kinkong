    "score": -6,
    "reasoning": "COMPUTE shows significant weakness compared to SOL in the current bearish market. With a 7.55% price drop in the last 24 hours while the overall market sentiment is bearish (20% confidence), COMPUTE is underperforming. The token's relatively low liquidity ($5,679) and 24h volume ($817) indicate limited trading activity and potential difficulty in accumulating tokens efficiently. The negative relative strength indicator (-9.0% AI tokens vs SOL) further confirms SOL's outperformance. With only 5% of position signals showing BUY recommendations, there's little institutional confidence. While the token maximizer strategy focuses on token quantity rather than USD value, positioning in SOL temporarily would likely allow for greater COMPUTE accumulation later when market conditions improve."
