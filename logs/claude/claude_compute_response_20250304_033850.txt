    "score": -6,
    "reasoning": "COMPUTE shows significant weakness compared to SOL in the current bearish market. With a 7.55% price drop in the last 24 hours while the overall market sentiment is bearish (20% confidence), COMPUTE is underperforming. The token's relatively low liquidity ($5,679) and 24h volume ($817) indicate limited trading activity and potential difficulty in accumulating tokens efficiently. The negative relative strength indicator shows AI tokens underperforming SOL by 9%, and with only 5% of position signals being BUY, there's little institutional confidence. The token maximizer strategy would be challenged in this environment as COMPUTE appears likely to continue losing value against SOL in the near term, making it more efficient to hold SOL and convert later when COMPUTE reaches lower levels."
