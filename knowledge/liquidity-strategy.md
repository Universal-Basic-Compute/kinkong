# KinKong Liquidity Providing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines KinKong's strategy for providing liquidity to UBC/SOL and COMPUTE/SOL pools, enhancing ecosystem support while generating yield.

## Core Strategy

### Liquidity Allocation
- **UBC/SOL Pool**: 60% of liquidity budget
- **COMPUTE/SOL Pool**: 40% of liquidity budget
- **Rebalance Frequency**: Weekly (every Friday)

### Pool Selection Criteria
1. **Concentrated Liquidity Ranges**
   - UBC/SOL: ±20% from current price
   - COMPUTE/SOL: ±15% from current price
   - Adjust ranges based on 30-day volatility metrics

2. **Fee Tier Selection**
   - UBC/SOL: 0.3% fee tier (balanced approach)
   - COMPUTE/SOL: 0.3% fee tier (balanced approach)
   - Review fee performance monthly

### Position Management

#### Entry Strategy
- Staggered entry across 3 days to average price exposure
- Initial positions at 50% of target allocation
- Remaining 50% deployed after 7-day performance evaluation

#### Rebalancing Rules
- Rebalance when price moves outside 50% of defined range
- Rebalance when impermanent loss exceeds 2% of position value
- Mandatory weekly evaluation (Fridays at 16:00 UTC)
- Emergency rebalance during extreme volatility (>30% daily move)

#### Exit Conditions
- Significant fundamental changes to either token
- Liquidity utilization falls below 30% for 7 consecutive days
- Better yield opportunities identified (>25% higher APR)
- Emergency protocol activation

### Risk Management

#### Impermanent Loss Mitigation
- Maximum 30% of total portfolio in liquidity positions
- Hedging with 5% allocation to out-of-range options
- Weekly IL calculation and threshold monitoring
- Partial exit when IL exceeds 5% of position value

#### Security Measures
- Smart contract audit verification before deployment
- Liquidity deployed only to official Orca/Raydium pools
- Multi-signature authorization for position adjustments
- Real-time monitoring of pool contract activity

### Performance Metrics

#### Key Performance Indicators
- Total Fee APR (annualized)
- Impermanent Loss Percentage
- Net Yield (Fees - IL)
- Pool Utilization Rate
- Price Impact Contribution

#### Reporting Cadence
- Daily fee accrual monitoring
- Weekly comprehensive performance review
- Monthly strategy optimization analysis
- Quarterly risk assessment

## Implementation Process

### Technical Setup
1. Connect to Orca/Raydium concentrated liquidity pools via API
2. Implement automated monitoring for position status
3. Configure alerts for rebalancing triggers
4. Develop dashboard for real-time performance tracking

### Operational Workflow
1. **Analysis Phase** (Thursday)
   - Review market conditions
   - Calculate optimal ranges
   - Determine allocation adjustments

2. **Execution Phase** (Friday)
   - Close underperforming positions
   - Open new positions with updated ranges
   - Rebalance existing positions as needed

3. **Monitoring Phase** (Continuous)
   - Track fee generation hourly
   - Monitor price movements
   - Calculate impermanent loss
   - Check pool utilization metrics

### Integration with Trading Strategy
- Liquidity positions complement trading strategy by:
  * Providing additional yield during sideways markets
  * Reducing overall portfolio volatility
  * Supporting ecosystem liquidity
  * Generating consistent fee income

## Expected Outcomes

### Target Metrics
- **Fee Generation**: 15-25% APR
- **Impermanent Loss**: <10% annually
- **Net Yield**: 10-15% APR
- **Utilization Rate**: >70% average

### Strategic Benefits
- Enhanced token utility and ecosystem support
- Reduced slippage for KinKong trading operations
- Additional revenue stream independent of market direction
- Deeper market integration and protocol support

## Monitoring and Optimization

### Continuous Improvement
- Monthly review of range optimization strategies
- Testing of alternative liquidity deployment methods
- Comparison with single-sided staking returns
- Analysis of fee tier performance

### Risk Adjustments
- Reduce allocation during extreme market volatility
- Widen ranges during uncertain market conditions
- Implement dynamic fee tier selection based on volume
- Adjust position sizes based on historical IL metrics
